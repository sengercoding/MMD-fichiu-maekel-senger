    "The probability that one machine doesnt fail during the time T is $1-p$, so the probability that all machines dont fail is $(1-p)^n$. The probability that at least one machine fails is the complement of this, so $1-(1-p)^n$.\n",

    "Since there are two outcomes and the machines are independent, we  can use the binomial distribution. The probability that exactly k machines fail is given by the binomial distribution: $P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### c)\n",
    "If we look at all the possible outcomes of the machines, we get $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} = 1$. This is because the sum of all probabilities of all possible outcomes is 1. This already almost looks like the formula we got, except for the k=0 case. We know from previously that for k=0 this is $(1-p)^n$, so we can rewrite the formula as $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} + (1-p)^n = 1$. Therefore we see that $p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} = 1 - (1-p)^n$."

    "The Java Class HashMap extends the Class AbstractMap and implements the interface Map. It gets K - the type of keys maintained by the map - and V - the type of mapped values - as parameters. The class has a default constructor that creates an empty HashMap with the default initial capacity (16) and load factor (0.75). The capacity is the number of bucktes in the hash table and the load factor is a measure of how full the has table is allowed to get before its capacity is automatically increased. \n",
