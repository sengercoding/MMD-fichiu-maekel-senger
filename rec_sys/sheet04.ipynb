    "Since there are two outcomes and the machines are independent, we  can use the binomial distribution. The probability that exactly k machines fail is given by the binomial distribution: $P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$.\n",

    "If we look at all the possible outcomes of the machines, we get $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} = 1$. This is because the sum of all probabilities of all possible outcomes is 1. This already almost looks like the formula we got, except for the k=0 case. We know from previously that for k=0 this is $(1-p)^n$, so we can rewrite the formula as $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} + (1-p)^n = 1$. Therefore we see that $p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} = 1 - (1-p)^n$."
